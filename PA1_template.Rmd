## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "factor" , "numeric"))
activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d"))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(activity, aes(x=date,y=steps)) + geom_histogram(stat="identity")
tapply(activity$steps[!is.na(activity$steps)] , activity$date[!is.na(activity$steps)], mean) 
tapply(activity$steps[!is.na(activity$steps)] , activity$date[!is.na(activity$steps)], median) 
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
a<-tapply(activity$steps[!is.na(activity$steps)] , activity$interval[!is.na(activity$steps)], mean)
aggplot(activity, aes(x=a)) + geom_histogram(stat="identity")
```

[!is.na(activity$steps)]

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
